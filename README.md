# Survey-Builder

ou are asked to create a survey builder where an admin can create surveys with a dynamic number of questions and dynamic number of answers with the ability to have different types of answer choices (radio buttons, checkboxes, inputs..). A normal user can see the list of surveys and take any of them, the survey will be marked as completed when done, can reset answers and do it all over again. Use React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend and MongoDB as a database.

Note that both users should be able to signup/sign in and JWT implementation is required. Each user has a profile where they can upload and save their profile picture.
